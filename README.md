I got super tired of waiting for August to implement the "SmartSense" (contact sensor) functionality.  No communication whatsoever.  Also, I think it's pretty silly that the only handler available that implements the contact sensor funtionality of the August Z-Wave lock is behind a pay-wall.

One hour later...  this thing.

Besides the August Lock Pro 3rd Gen (with Z-Wave) this repo also contains a few other device handlers.  So far:

- August Lock Pro 3rd Gen (Z-Wave)
- Gledopto 2.4G Wireless RGBW LED Controller (Zigbee) 
- Gledopto 2.4G Wireless RGBW LED Controller White Channel (Zigbee) (separate child device handler for the white channel. meh.)
- OpenGarage (WiFi)
- Monoprice Z-Wave Plus Smart Plug and Repeater with 2 USB Ports Always On (Z-Wave)
